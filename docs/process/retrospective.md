## 2026-03-09 - PR #67 Copilot Review Feedback

**What worked:**
- Comprehensive Copilot review caught 15 real issues (security, correctness, docs)
- Systematic addressing: security first, then correctness, then docs/quality
- DOM manipulation pattern eliminated XSS risk entirely vs trying to sanitize innerHTML

**What didn't:**
- Original PR missed several security fundamentals: email verification check, fail-closed allowlist, cookie parsing edge cases
- Dashboard kill endpoint didn't verify orchestrator DB update succeeded before shutting down container
- Documentation had several inaccuracies (threat model, deprecated API references)

**Action:**
- Security checklist for future OAuth/auth PRs: verify email flags, fail-closed configs, proper cookie parsing, KV consistency notes
- Always validate orchestrator/DB state changes before proceeding with side effects (container shutdown, notifications)
- Keep threat model docs in sync with implementation - audit on every security change

## 2026-03-08 - BC-125: Agent Dashboard with Google OAuth

**What worked:**
- Reusing existing orchestrator `/status` endpoint instead of creating new data layer
- Single-page HTML approach (no build step, no framework dependencies)
- Leveraging Cloudflare KV for session storage (automatic TTL, distributed)
- Security-first design from the start (OAuth CSRF, HttpOnly cookies, email allowlist)
- Comprehensive documentation (setup guide + user guide + inline comments)
- TypeScript type safety caught issues early (cookie header types, query param nullability)

**What didn't:**
- Initial HTML import type declaration didn't work (`export default` vs `export =`)
- Had to add `@ts-ignore` for HTML import (wrangler handles it but TypeScript doesn't understand)
- User requested security review mid-implementation - should have proactively documented security considerations first
- Git identity not configured in container - minor delay on commit

**Action:**
- Template: When adding authentication to a Cloudflare Worker, use KV + OAuth + session cookies pattern (proven secure + simple)
- Documentation: Always include security section in implementation docs before asking for review
- Agent containers: Consider pre-configuring git identity to avoid commit delays
